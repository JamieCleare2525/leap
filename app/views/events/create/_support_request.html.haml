  %h1 Support Request
  %p 
    These can be used to request support for learners.
    %ul
      %li
        Choose the difficulties the learner requires support for (hold down
        the <i>Ctrl</i> key to select more than one difficulty).
      %li
        Choose the timetable sessions the learner requires support for 
        (again, using <i>Ctrl</i> for multiple selections). If the learner
        has no current timetable sessions, this will be blank - just ignore
        it!
      %li 
        If the learner requires a support workshop, use the checkbox.
  %p 
    Your request will be reviewed by curriculum support staff.
