Leap got a highly favorable mention in the 2011/12 Ofsted Best Practice Survey at South Devon College.

In the letter to the college, Linda Truscott, said:

bq. The college makes particularly effective use of technology to support
  students. Students and their tutors use the collegeâ€™s Learner Engagement and
  Progression (LEAP) system very successfully to set targets and review
  progress. A contact log records meaningful information about individual
  interventions and alerts support staff to students who may be at-risk of
  non completion.

The resulting Best Practice Resource talks in glowing terms of the access to ICT resources and how target setting and progression is tracked.
