Last week I spent three days in Swindon installing and configuring Leap at "Swindon College.":http://www.swindon-college.ac.uk This will be the first Leap installation of Leap outside of its original home at "South Devon College":http://www.southdevon.ac.uk and it's very exciting! Actually getting Leap running was pretty straight-forward. Swindon use EBS, like we do, as their MIS and integration went smoothly, and thanks must go to the staff up there, in particular their Computer Services team for their preparations and support during my visit.

At the moment, developments done for Leap in Swindon College are sitting on a new branch (appropriately named "Swindon") in the repo. I'm merging that back into the master branch as soon as I've satisfied that they won't break anything back at SDC.

So Leap is running at Swindon. What I'm working on in the moment is covering some of the gaps left where we assume the existence of some (often bespoke) software at South Devon, and replacing them with purre Leap functionality. Then it's let them have a play around and I'm back up to do some more formal workshop-style training.

What's mostly exciting is that this project is the proof-of-concept that Leap can successfully run outside of it's confort zone at South Devon and we can look forward to engaging with other institutions in the future. And I really can't wait till we get the first pull github pull request from another developer!
