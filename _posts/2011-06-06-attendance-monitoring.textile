Just a quick post with a little bit of new functionality.

One of the important uses of the eilp at South Devon College is for monitoring attendance. In ilp2 we will drop an event into each student's stream each week showing their current culminative attendance as a percentage. It also shows their attendance for the last week and last three weeks for extra information. Then there's a little sparkline graph for picking out trends.

This is, of course, great for setting targets against. A future feature will enable targets to be set against attendances easily with calculations for what attendance can be acheived for a particular time period automatically calculated, as well as a more detailed graph in the expanded mode for the event.
