title: New Website and Blog

The old Leap website was literally hacked up between Brian Crocker, Dee Jarvis and myself in a couple of hours when we went public with the code and we had a sudden reaslisation that we didn't have a home for it on the web - the blog was hosted on Posterous for similar reasons. It was always the intention to redo the whole thing once the dust had settled and finally that time had come.

Github has prooved to be an amazing resource for Leap, and for other college projects both open and closed, so it seemed sensible to use the hosting ability there. I've plans also to start using the wiki to build support resources for both users and developers. We've built quite a few support materials over the last eight months of use at South Devon College and at least some of those would sit within the wiki nicely. That's for the (hopefully not too distant) future though. 

Meanwhile, I've also set up a Google Plus page for Leap. It has nothing on it. Any ideas?
