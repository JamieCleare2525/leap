As is traditional for weblogs about developing a software system, I will start off with an apology about the lack of updates. Happily, the cause of this isn't that development has slowed; rather it is continuing at a frantic pace to ready things for the the release of Leap into production at South Devon College.

Once we've got some breathing space I'll post some more in depth information about things I haven't covered yet including some really interesting (well, to me) stuff about how the different views of events are built (one line the database!) for different types of users, and I hope to actually start talking about how the system can be used from a teaching perspective.

For now, though, I've bundled up a screenshot of the home page each person sees as a nice taster of how things are going.
