    <p class="first">The timeline is central to Leap. It's where the story of a learner's journey is told.</p>

    <p>Relevant, timely information from your institution's information systems is automatically collected and displayed in a familiar, consistent layout, and combined with input from learners and staff.</p>

    <p>Notes, targets, enrolments, qualifications, reviews, attendance, support, disiplinaries and more are used to set the context and provide inspiration for future plans and goals.</p>

    <p>Learners are kept informed of their learning targets and are encouraged to reflect as they progress.</p>

    <p>A simple menu enables users to filter the timeline to home in on particluar areas and can be easily configured to provide different access levels to learners, staff, parents and applicants.</p>

    <p>Staff can also see the timeline at a course-level or even an overview for the entire institution.</p>

  <div class="col">
    <p class="first">With the Leap timetable, learners can easily see where they need to be and what's coming up.</p>

    <p>Register marks are collected automatically from your institution's MIS in real-time so the information is always up to date and correct. </p>

    <p>Weekly attendance graphs are calculated and added to learners' timelines showing trends and providing another inspiration for relevant target-setting.</p>

    <p>Timetables can also be helpful for staff, offering a nice overview of learners' attendance and their own teaching timetables are available too.</p>

    <p>And all this happens without any additional set up or maintainance!</p>

  <div class="col">
    <p class="first">The home pages provide a simple overview of what's important to learners right now.</p>

    <p>It's a jumping off-point with quick access to what users need. Learners are given a quick and simple way to make notes and reminded immediately of their upcoming targets. A trend graph of attendance is calculated automatically from your institution's registers.</p>

    <p>Notification of next timetabled sessions are shown for learners and staff and can be expanded to a full timetable. </p>

    <p>Integration with your institution's VLE means they can jump straight into their courses and Leap works with the UK standard Shibboleth authentication for single sign-on between systems.</p>

    <p>And for staff, there's a home page for courses with visual class lists getting them to the detailed information they need about their course's progression.</p>
