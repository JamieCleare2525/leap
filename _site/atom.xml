   <title>Towards 1.0. Rails 3.1, Jquery, coffeescript and refactoring.</title>

   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/10/22/towards-one-point-oh</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before I start this post, I&amp;#8217;d like to say thanks to all for the warm reception and genuine interest we received at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VLE&lt;/span&gt; forum. Hopefully we can make this a true collaborative project in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned that we&amp;#8217;re making a release after half-term (next week) that we will call 1.0. This is by no means going to mean a pause in development but I&amp;#8217;m going to talk about a few changes we&amp;#8217;ll see in 1.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rails 3.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re making the jump to Rails 3.1, including use of lots of its goodness. All the images, javascript and stylesheets are using the asset pipeline. This should have a few positive effects on Leap, speed and such, but my favourite is that it&amp;#8217;s simplifying the codebase; the javascript libraries are now stored in gems on the server so they&amp;#8217;re removed from Leap&amp;#8217;s repositories (I wonder if Ohloh will recognise it as a ruby project instead of a JS one now!) and only the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SCSS&lt;/span&gt; source of stylesheets instead of the compiled ones. A major goal of Leap development is to kep the code small and easily maintainable by a tiny development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jquery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails 3.1 has changed the default javascript framework from Prototype to Jquery, and we&amp;#8217;re doing the same with Leap. I did like Prototype, but learning Jquery has proved interesting and I&amp;#8217;ve been able to remove a lot of complexity where &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AJAX&lt;/span&gt; is used to do things like open up the extended pulldown on events. I&amp;#8217;m hoping (but am not able to check until Monday) that it&amp;#8217;s also going to clear up some issues I had with Internet Explorer compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coffeescript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also related with the move to Rails 3.1 and the asset pipeline, I&amp;#8217;ve rewritten all the JS as coffeescript. I found coffeescript lovely to start to learn and makes all that ugly JS much more expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews will finally be in, written to a spec we&amp;#8217;ve come up with at South Devon College. We&amp;#8217;ve had the stop-gap initial reviews for a while and, as it turns out, the full reviews will be much influenced by their sucess. This will be the subject of a full post to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And more!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s been a few smaller features: deleting events (for a configurable amount of time after they&amp;#8217;re created) is a good example, and there&amp;#8217;s been some more refactoring of eventable objects into pure event behaviour. After 1.0 release I&amp;#8217;m going to have to do some serious documentation on how this stuff works&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>A Month After Launch</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/10/11/a-month-after-launch.html"/>
   <updated>2011-10-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/10/11/a-month-after-launch</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So Leap has been in production use at South Devon College for just over a month now. It&amp;#8217;s seeing over a thousand logins a day (during the week) with over two thirds of those being from students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as teething problems go, we&amp;#8217;ve been pretty happy (touch wood). A few tweaks here and there and some problems caused by timetables (out of my control), but mostly Leap has sailed through with no outages or particularly bad problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a learning process at the moment. It&amp;#8217;s actually being used pretty well by students and staff already but, once things have settled, we&amp;#8217;re going have to start helping people to really get the most out of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also still a development system. I&amp;#8217;m rolling out features all the time, but come half term (in a couple of weeks) I&amp;#8217;m going to call it 1.0 and we&amp;#8217;ll settle into a release cycle. To start with it&amp;#8217;s probably going to be half-termly to begin with, but we&amp;#8217;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So students have been making notes, setting and meeting targets, checking timetables and whatnot. Staff have been enthusiastic in their take-up of features like contact logs and they&amp;#8217;ll soon be into writing the first proper reviews. By the way, reviews aren&amp;#8217;t in the repo yet, but will be by the end of half term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a hastily thrown-together website for the project at http://leap-ilp.com which I&amp;#8217;ll hopefully make a bit better when time allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have some features that haven&amp;#8217;t been mentioned on this blog: home pages for courses, a &amp;#8220;my courses&amp;#8221; block for staff, absence reporting (although this won&amp;#8217;t work outside of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDC&lt;/span&gt; yet) and, oh loads more. But there is an issue, which is that documentation is thin on the ground anyway. Now that the system is launched I hope to make some regular posts about the use of the system, instead of that technical stuff and then we could well tie that stuff together to make a user guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;m off to create a presentation for the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSC&lt;/span&gt; SW &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VLE&lt;/span&gt; Forum on Thursday&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Source Code Available</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/09/01/source-code-available.html"/>
   <updated>2011-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/09/01/source-code-available</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to say that the source is now released for leap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head on down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/sdc/leap&quot;&gt;http://github.com/sdc/leap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an issue, however. We&amp;#8217;ve released the source, as we said we would and will continue to do, but it&amp;#8217;s not going to work at your institution&amp;#8230; yet. The first goal of Leap was to replace the current system in use at South Devon College and, as such, we&amp;#8217;ve made some assumptions which are not going to cause problems somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not all bad, though. The system has been designed to work elsewhere, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SDC&lt;/span&gt;-specific bits are quite small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are at an institution (we&amp;#8217;d prefer one using &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; to start with) and you&amp;#8217;re interested, please get in contact and we can start work on getting the system fully portable.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Home Page Screenshot</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/08/16/home-page-screenshot.html"/>
   <updated>2011-08-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/08/16/home-page-screenshot</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As is traditional for weblogs about developing a software system, I will start off with an apology about the lack of updates. Happily, the cause of this isn&amp;#8217;t that development has slowed; rather it is continuing at a frantic pace to ready things for the the release of Leap into production at South Devon College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we&amp;#8217;ve got some breathing space I&amp;#8217;ll post some more in depth information about things I haven&amp;#8217;t covered yet including some really interesting (well, to me) stuff about how the different views of events are built (one line the database!) for different types of users, and I hope to actually start talking about how the system can be used from a teaching perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, though, I&amp;#8217;ve bundled up a screenshot of the home page each person sees as a nice taster of how things are going.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/leap.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#8217;re getting close to launch time for the new eilp at South Devon College &amp;#8211; and we&amp;#8217;ve got a new name and logo to go with it. The name is Leap and the logo you see above you. I&amp;#8217;m not going to go into the name or logo much because names don&amp;#8217;t matter. If Leap does the job as a system then the name will be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#8217;d list what&amp;#8217;s working so far. It&amp;#8217;s just a list, I&amp;#8217;m not going to go too deeply into the functionality yet, but it&amp;#8217;ll give an idea of what Leap is capable of &amp;#8211; and what&amp;#8217;s still to be done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this stuff works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Authentication, handled by Shibboleth supporting Staff and Student affiliations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Searching for people by name or id in Leap.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Searching for people by name or id in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; and automatically importing them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Most of the home page for students including:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Personal Details&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Posting notes to own event list&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Next lesson from timetable (with location)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Attendance summary with graph&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Targets to be met&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Link to moodle courses (automatically built using Moodle&amp;#8217;s web services)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Events list including:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Enrolments &amp;#8211; automatically pulled in from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Targets which can be set by students or staff against any other event and automatically generate timely reminders&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Contact Logs &amp;#8211; showing the photo of the contact&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Support Requests with sessions pulled from timetable.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Positive Intervention&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Qualification achieved &amp;#8211; pulled in from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; and can be added&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Notes &amp;#8211; can be added by students&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Course views showing event information for all students on a course&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All People view showing filtered events across the whole system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Timetables with live attendance data&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Probably a couple of other things I&amp;#8217;ve temporarily forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reviews. This partly works with a couple of issues. Should be sorted in the next week or so.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Where's the Code?</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/07/15/wheres-the-code.html"/>
   <updated>2011-07-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/07/15/wheres-the-code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My last post attracted a comment regarding availability of the source code, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d better write a post explaining the state of play at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major goal of this ilp project is to replace another system currently used at South Devon College. This previous system was also designed and developed by us and has run very well for three years. The time had come, however, to address some of its shortcomings and this new project is the product of that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to roll the new system into production use at the college at the beginning of the next academic year (in September). Demonstrations and testing we have doine with college staff show far have received positive feedback, and we are on track, but we have a lot of work to do to get things ready before then. This means that all our resources are currently focussed on acheiving this initial goal (along with a migration to Moodle 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have rolled out the system at South Devon we will be releasing the code but bear in mind that is unlikely that the project, at this point, will simply be a &amp;#8216;drop-in&amp;#8217; application for another institution. We&amp;#8217;ve abstracted things as much as we can but I expect that an initial aim of the open source release will be to work on getting the system to actually function at institutions other than South Devon College. Barriers to this may include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The system assumes the presence of a properly-configured Shibboleth Service Provider to provide authentication. No other authentication mechanism is currently supported (except for a testing system which doesn&amp;#8217;t require a password), although I can&amp;#8217;t see why it would be difficult to change this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Student data can only be obtained through an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; system. We have designed this connection to be able to connect to other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; systems by writing a single library file to convert between the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; and the ilp but I&amp;#8217;ve not tested this on any other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt;. There is a testing library, however, which always returns no data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even if you do have an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; system, it&amp;#8217;s likely that I&amp;#8217;ve made assumptions about the way data is represented which are specific to South Devon College. In fact, there&amp;#8217;s a couple of places where I know this is the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I want to put anyone off! I&amp;#8217;m excited to start trying to port the system to other institutions but I can&amp;#8217;t spend any time on this until I&amp;#8217;ve filled my obligations to the College for release in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the code is coming. If anyone out there is interested in getting involved &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; get in touch with me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:khughes@southdevon.ac.uk&quot;&gt;khughes@southdevon.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt; . We&amp;#8217;ve got a few interested parties already and the earlier you get involved the more influence you can have over design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, lots more work has been done on the system and I do apologise for not documenting it here yet. I&amp;#8217;ll try to post again soon with some more details of how things are going :)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Attendance Monitoring</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/06/06/attendance-monitoring.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post with a little bit of new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important uses of the eilp at South Devon College is for monitoring attendance. In ilp2 we will drop an event into each student&amp;#8217;s stream each week showing their current culminative attendance as a percentage. It also shows their attendance for the last week and last three weeks for extra information. Then there&amp;#8217;s a little sparkline graph for picking out trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/attendance_event.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, great for setting targets against. A future feature will enable targets to be set against attendances easily with calculations for what attendance can be acheived for a particular time period automatically calculated, as well as a more detailed graph in the expanded mode for the event.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Timetable</title>

   <updated>2011-05-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/05/20/timetable</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apologies for not posting for ages; I&amp;#8217;ve been distracted by other projects. We&amp;#8217;re also in the middle of a project to roll out an upgrade to Moodle 2 for September and the normal maintenance and issues have been cropping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eilp project is continuing apace, however, and I&amp;#8217;ve got a new lump of functionality to show you: timetables. The timetables have always been a popular part of the current ilp and it comes with its own issues. The biggest of these is the sheer amount of information needed to be pulled from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t really want to import this info like I do with the personal details and enrolment data, since it changes very quickly and a good feature of the current timetable has been its real-time nature; attendance marks are updated immediately. Checking for and importing changes every time would be far too slow. So I&amp;#8217;ve opted for a compromise. The data is read in real time from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; and converted into in-memory models which are displayed on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all seems to work quite well. It&amp;#8217;s not completely finished though. Missing from this screenshot is a way to navigate to other weeks and the register maks themselves. Also, I will be adding the teachers&amp;#8217; names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leap/images/blog/timetable.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/timetable_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another issue. Everyone uses different register marks. &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; lets you arbitrarily make them up. There&amp;#8217;s no way I can program in all the possible ways and nuances for each different type of absence, sickness, etc. Luckily, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; helps us a bit here. It has a table to map between the college&amp;#8217;s attendance marks and a generic present, absent or sick mark. That&amp;#8217;s where the colour-coding comes from. This will work across any institution and will be what I use to calculate attendance percentages from. I just hope other &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; systems have a similar feature!&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Events and Transitions</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/02/24/events-and-transitions.html"/>
   <updated>2011-02-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/02/24/events-and-transitions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a little bit abstract, but it&amp;#8217;s quite important to how the guts of this system are going to work&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the aims of ilp2 (yes, I know it needs a proper name) is to simplify development and maintenance. One of the ways we&amp;#8217;re doing this is to represent everything in the system as an event. We have objects and database tables for all the object themselves (courses, targets, people, whatever) but each of them is associated with one or more events, and it&amp;#8217;s only ever the &lt;em&gt;event&lt;/em&gt; that is displayed on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/objects_and_events.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dramatically reduces duplication of code (something which is rampant in the current ilp) and enables us to do things like enforce security in one place, rather than all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of the information is stored in the object itself. When we display an event on the screen, it asks its associated object for the information to display. The object knows which information to return, because each event is a &lt;em&gt;transition&lt;/em&gt; and this state is passed to the object. Now the transition doesn&amp;#8217;t really mean anything, it&amp;#8217;s just a label (actuallly a ruby symbol) which is passed, but the object needs to have some idea of what that means. So I&amp;#8217;ve come up with some standard transitions which map well to the sorts of events we&amp;#8217;re going to need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/event_status.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks a little like a state machine doesn&amp;#8217;t it? It&amp;#8217;s not, though. It&amp;#8217;s just some labels; the arrows are to add meaning to them for us but aren&amp;#8217;t actually represented in the system. (I did look into using a state machine for this, but it seemed that it just added complexity for no real gain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how about some examples of how these map to real objects like courses or targets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/eventsandtransitions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice by-product of this is a simple way to produce pages showing certain types of information. The current ilp has links to pages for a specific learner with, for instance, their courses or their targets on it. We already have filtering events by type, and now I can do filtering by transition. With these two you can build any page you want. A list of enrolments? Just show the events where eventable_type is course and transition is start. Obviously we can&amp;#8217;t expect users to work this out for themselves, but convienience links can be built which will do this for you. These can be configurable and, because they&amp;#8217;re really only links to to the list of events with a few extra parameters, it all just works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how we&amp;#8217;re going to build the sidebar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/sidebar2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the timetable and home links. They&amp;#8217;re special cases. As an aside, see the number below the name? That&amp;#8217;s the Unique Learner Number (actually it&amp;#8217;s mine!). We&amp;#8217;re using that everywhere instead of internal user ids to prevent problems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used this stuff to build up to how we&amp;#8217;re going to to learner reviews. That&amp;#8217;ll be the subject of my next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, please comment on any of this stuff. If you see a horrible problem up the road, I&amp;#8217;d much rather hear about it now! Much of this design is extending three years&amp;#8217; experience of eilp at South Devon College out to the wider world, and I&amp;#8217;m very aware that there may be issues in translating this stuff to other institutions&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I presented about ilp2 at the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JISC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSC&lt;/span&gt; SW &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VLE&lt;/span&gt; Forum today. Thanks to everyone for the interest demonstrated. It&amp;#8217;s relieving to see that everyone seemed to &amp;#8216;get&amp;#8217; the project and there was more than a little interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to extend the invitation to eveyone again, if you&amp;#8217;re in any way interested, to get involved in the project. The involvement can take any form from discussion, through testing and up to full involvement in development. We&amp;#8217;re determined to set this project free, you won&amp;#8217;t be involved in my project or South Devon College&amp;#8217;s project, but yours. If you want any more information, email me, comment on weblog posts, talk to me on twitter or any other way you can find to communicate :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the presentation I gave today. The first few slides show functionality in the current (ilp1) system being used at South Devon College, most of which will be replicated, and hopefully improved, in the new version. The second half is an introduction to some of the ideas to go in ilp2.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to be at the next &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JISC&lt;/span&gt; South West &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VLE&lt;/span&gt; Forum at Taunton School on 9th February 2011. I&amp;#8217;ll be doing a presentation about the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ILP&lt;/span&gt; project. I haven&amp;#8217;t written the presentation yet, but there&amp;#8217;ll be something about why the project is happening, what ideas we&amp;#8217;ve got for it, and how far we&amp;#8217;ve got with them. Plus, of course, questions and (hopefully) answers. I&amp;#8217;ll be demonstrating our current ilp, where it&amp;#8217;s relevant, and some early work on the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest in the project, please come along. I&amp;#8217;m happy to talk about any aspect of it with anyone. And if there&amp;#8217;s anything anyone would like me to cover in the presentation, tell me and I&amp;#8217;ll try to fit it in.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some Working Code</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/24/some-working_code.html"/>
   <updated>2011-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/24/some-working_code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that so far, on this blog, I&amp;#8217;ve only shown mockups and discussed ideas without giving any clue to the fact that development is underway and moving forward quite briskly. Much of the work so far has been on data modelling end of the system, so there&amp;#8217;s not a lot that I can really show but some of the event view has been written, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d upload some screenshots of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenshots are of a new &amp;#8216;Mumble&amp;#8217; type event, closed and open, and what happens when you attach a new target to that. Obviously this all sits within a layout, but I&amp;#8217;m not showing that yet because it doesn&amp;#8217;t look up to much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Note Event&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/leap/images/blog/closed_note.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Settin a Target on the Note Event&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/open_note.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Target Now Set&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/set_target.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Target Feedback&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/open_target.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks better in practice than on these screenshots, because you can&amp;#8217;t see all the nice &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;AJAX&lt;/span&gt; and Scriptaculous animation, but it&amp;#8217;s something to look at. There&amp;#8217;s quite a lot of work gone on behind these admittedly simple-looking blocks of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, which should mean that the perceived speed of development should increase quite rapidly as I move from this low-level code, to implementing new event types over the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the more data-oriented stuff goes, I&amp;#8217;ve got learners&amp;#8217; personal details imporing from our &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; and being cached in the ilp database, and I&amp;#8217;ve put out some testing tools to login as users without having to go through Shibboleth (which is how I expect login to work on a production system). I&amp;#8217;ve also got pretty good coverage with unit tests, which is something I always regretted not doing with the old eilp system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Connecting to your MIS</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/21/connecting-to-your-mis.html"/>
   <updated>2011-01-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/21/connecting-to-your-mis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A huge advantage of our current eilp is the direct connection to Management Information Data. This means we get student and course data which we know is correct, in real time. A student can enrol on a course, walk round the corner, log into eilp and see that enrolment straight away. The timetable is updated with attendance data as soon as the register is taken. Also, no massive overnight batch jobs are needed to keep things in sync and noone has to work on the data&amp;#8230; it just &lt;em&gt;works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to keep all these advantages in the new system, but a new requirement is &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; independence. We use &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt; at South Devon College, but we want you to (theoretically) be able to use any &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt;. So this is how we&amp;#8217;re doing it. We&amp;#8217;re going to model the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; data we need for each &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; type in their own namespace. Now we can&amp;#8217;t talk to these models straight from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ILP&lt;/span&gt; models, since they may work completely seperately, so we have an &lt;em&gt;mis_connector&lt;/em&gt; for each &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt;. Ilp classes talk to this, which get the right data and return it to the Ilp using standard ilp models:&lt;br /&gt;
Mis_connectors_general&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/mis_connectors_general.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about an example? This &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UML&lt;/span&gt;-ish class diagram shows you the actual classes carrying out a request for a new Person object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leap/images/blog/person_connection.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/person_connection_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Person class has a get method which, in turn, loads the get_person object from the MisConnector. What happens next depends on which MisConnector you have loaded (which will be easily configurable). In this specific example, it invokes the Ebs::Person and Ebs::Address classes to get the data it needs from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; and then returns a fully formed standard ilp Person Model. This is cached on the ilp&amp;#8217;s database for speed &amp;#8211; and so it all still works when the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we&amp;#8217;re only working on a connector for &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EBS&lt;/span&gt;, because that&amp;#8217;s what we need to replace our current system. But this abstraction should let us talk to any &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; by Modelling the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; data and writing an MisConnector to do the translation.&lt;br /&gt;
Issues to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much should we read from the cached data, and how often should we refresh it from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should some time-critical information like timetables be read directly from the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; without caching?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should we do something similar for connections to &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VLE&lt;/span&gt;? Or just assume Moodle?&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Extra Details and Functionality for Some Events</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/14/extra-details-and-functionality-for-some-events.html"/>
   <updated>2011-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/14/extra-details-and-functionality-for-some-events</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having all these different types of event looking the same and being treated the same is excellent for consistency of user interface and re-usability of code but some types of event need some extra functionality. A perfect example of this is targets. The abstracted functionality of events is OK for setting and displaying targets, reminding us when their due and noting their completion, but how does the user make a target completed? And how do they provide reflective comments on that completion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve come up with a tabbed interface on the extended part of events which can display arbitrary info and controls from the type of event. This is the interface for targets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leap/images/blog/target_event.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/target_event_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that an event can declare that it has some functionality for the extended pane and return a path to a partial template to display it. If there is one, a tabbed interface is used, showing both that an the &amp;#8216;New Target&amp;#8217; interface already designed. If there isn&amp;#8217;t one, we just show the &amp;#8216;New Target&amp;#8217; bit as before, without any tabs. Simple to code and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I have now implemented much of the event functionality I&amp;#8217;ve talked about here, and it&amp;#8217;s working well. I&amp;#8217;ll soon post some screenshots of the working system to go along with these mockups and, hopefully, I&amp;#8217;ll soon have permission to open up the code repo on GitHub too!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Target Setting</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/07/target-setting.html"/>
   <updated>2011-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/07/target-setting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Target setting is central to any individual learning plan, and we intend to put it at the centre of the new eilp. One of the issues with our current system was that, although target setting was good as far as it went, it was somewhat isolated from everything else &amp;#8211; actually this was a general design issue with the old system: everything was isolated from everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new system we want learners to be able to set targets when and where they make sense and the best way to achieve this is to attach it to the event system. Any event in the system can have a target attached to it, and that new target will automatically generate new events (which could, in turn, have more targets set against them!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the event system occurred to me was the issue of us wanting high-quality &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SMART&lt;/span&gt; targets from learners, but also want them to be able to log targets themselves. The mumble (bad name, might be changed) event type lets this happen. Learners can post a mumble (just some text, whatever they&amp;#8217;re thinking about) easily, possibly from the front screen &amp;#8211; more on that later &amp;#8211; and it pops up in the event system to be turned into a decent target when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets have a look at some possibilities for a target-setting interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leap/images/blog/set_a_target.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/set_a_target_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You open up an event (in this case a note broadcast to everyone to remind them of an upcoming theme week) and they can set a target against that. The event itself serves as a way to inspire thinking about certain types of target learners may want to set (you can easily imagine other targets being set against set assignments or attendance data) and the target stays with that even for ever &amp;#8211; as well as generating its own events to remind the learner what he or she wants to work towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example here shows how some events could specialise. This attendance target won&amp;#8217;t let you set unachievable attendance targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Event System Mockups</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/06/event-system-mockup.html"/>
   <updated>2011-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/06/event-system-mockup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the new ilp system will be a new event system. Building on the ideas about ilp being mostly about timestamped personal data, I put together a mockup of how this could work (ignore the links on the left, they&amp;#8217;re imported from the current ilp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leap/images/blog/events_mockup.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/events_mockup_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that a learner can look at this page and easily see what&amp;#8217;s going on at any point. The great thing is how much we can fit into this design: assessments, targets, grades, announcements and loads more. And lots of this can be automatically generated: Moodle or the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIS&lt;/span&gt; can add things to the system. Reminders of due assignments, for example, don&amp;#8217;t have to be added to the ilp, Moodle will add them itself when the assignment is set. When it&amp;#8217;s graded, Moodle will post that into the ilp too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s some examples of possible events we could have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leap/images/blog/event_types.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/event_types_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because they&amp;#8217;re all similar, we can treat them the same and display them anywhere; within the ilp system we can move them around as if they were all the same type of object. This will make extending the system simple: all you have to do is write the code for the special bits, where this type of event does something different to others, and everything else should just work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done a bit of work on specifying standards for how the events should look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/leap/images/blog/an_event_with_minis.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/leap/images/blog/an_event_with_minis_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all the stuff on here at this point, none of this is set in stone. It&amp;#8217;s all about mocking stuff up and thinking about how it could work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Early Ideas</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/04/early-ideas.html"/>
   <updated>2011-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/04/early-ideas</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
This is a presentation I gave to the eilp meeting that we hold fortnightly at SDC. It was less a vision and more a bunch of possibilities. Having been the lead (read as: only) developer on the eilp system for several years, I had been incubating loads of ideas for some time and was getting a little frustrated with not being able to take on larger developments because of the pressure of many small wanted functions. I gave this presentation to the group as a way of sparking discussion of where we could go with the system if we regained a bit of our earlier ambition.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It's important to realise that this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a vision document of how the new eilp version would be, simply a starting point for thinking about what could be. It's important to note that some parts of it have already been accepted or rejected. One decision is that we're not going to be using MongoDB, but sticking to normal SQL. The reasons for this are many and I'll be happy to expand on it if anyone's interested, but the way I was looking at it in this presentation is pretty much completely wrong and unworkable - I've left it in, because it was actually starting to think about the data in different ways that led me to many of the key design considerations in the new version of the eilp, even if we are going to drop the technology itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Towards a New EILP</title>
   <link href="http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/04/a-new-eilp.html"/>
   <updated>2011-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://sdc.github.com/leap/2011/01/04/a-new-eilp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southdevon.ac.uk&quot;&gt;South Devon College&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;ve been running our own, in house, eilp for a few years now. It&amp;#8217;s been hugely successful, improving access to individual student data for both the students themselves and the staff who work with them and contributing to the college&amp;#8217;s culture of outstanding teaching and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, more and more functionality was added to the system, but development was not being done in the most structured matter. It had become bloated and had expanded in all directions. New development was being rushed and focus was being lost. Worst of all, much of the new development was concentrating on staff use, not the learner experience. Not that things are bad. Staff and students are still using it successfully every day, but it was decided that a major new revision would be developed with the learner at the centre. And we also made another decision: that the new developments would be open source. We would engage with the community and develop a top-quality system that everyone can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, we&amp;#8217;re still in the design stage, but some decisions have been made, and some proof-of-concept code has been written. We&amp;#8217;ve now set up this site to hopefully help encourage the growth of a community and as a place to log and discuss development. Hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll see exciting ideas evolve and come together to build a system which will be of benefit to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
