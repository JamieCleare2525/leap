  <h1>Early Ideas</h1>
  <p>
This is a presentation I gave to the eilp meeting that we hold fortnightly at SDC. It was less a vision and more a bunch of possibilities. Having been the lead (read as: only) developer on the eilp system for several years, I had been incubating loads of ideas for some time and was getting a little frustrated with not being able to take on larger developments because of the pressure of many small wanted functions. I gave this presentation to the group as a way of sparking discussion of where we could go with the system if we regained a bit of our earlier ambition.
</p><p>
It's important to realise that this is <strong>not</strong> a vision document of how the new eilp version would be, simply a starting point for thinking about what could be. It's important to note that some parts of it have already been accepted or rejected. One decision is that we're not going to be using MongoDB, but sticking to normal SQL. The reasons for this are many and I'll be happy to expand on it if anyone's interested, but the way I was looking at it in this presentation is pretty much completely wrong and unworkable - I've left it in, because it was actually starting to think about the data in different ways that led me to many of the key design considerations in the new version of the eilp, even if we are going to drop the technology itself.
