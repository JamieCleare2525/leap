  <h1>Event System Mockups</h1>
  <p>At the heart of the new ilp system will be a new event system. Building on the ideas about ilp being mostly about timestamped personal data, I put together a mockup of how this could work (ignore the links on the left, they&#8217;re imported from the current ilp).</p>
<p><a href="/leap/images/blog/events_mockup.png"><img src="/leap/images/blog/events_mockup_thumb.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The idea is that a learner can look at this page and easily see what&#8217;s going on at any point. The great thing is how much we can fit into this design: assessments, targets, grades, announcements and loads more. And lots of this can be automatically generated: Moodle or the <span class="caps">MIS</span> can add things to the system. Reminders of due assignments, for example, don&#8217;t have to be added to the ilp, Moodle will add them itself when the assignment is set. When it&#8217;s graded, Moodle will post that into the ilp too!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some examples of possible events we could have:</p>
<p><a href="/leap/images/blog/event_types.png"><img src="/leap/images/blog/event_types_thumb.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>And because they&#8217;re all similar, we can treat them the same and display them anywhere; within the ilp system we can move them around as if they were all the same type of object. This will make extending the system simple: all you have to do is write the code for the special bits, where this type of event does something different to others, and everything else should just work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a bit of work on specifying standards for how the events should look:</p>

<p>As with all the stuff on here at this point, none of this is set in stone. It&#8217;s all about mocking stuff up and thinking about how it could work.</p>
