  <h1>Source Code Available</h1>
  <p>Just a quick post to say that the source is now released for leap.</p>
<p>Head on down to <a href="http://github.com/sdc/leap">http://github.com/sdc/leap</a></p>
<p>There is an issue, however. We&#8217;ve released the source, as we said we would and will continue to do, but it&#8217;s not going to work at your institution&#8230; yet. The first goal of Leap was to replace the current system in use at South Devon College and, as such, we&#8217;ve made some assumptions which are not going to cause problems somewhere else.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all bad, though. The system has been designed to work elsewhere, and <span class="caps">SDC</span>-specific bits are quite small.</p>
<p>If you are at an institution (we&#8217;d prefer one using <span class="caps">EBS</span> to start with) and you&#8217;re interested, please get in contact and we can start work on getting the system fully portable.</p>
