  <h1>Towards 1.0. Rails 3.1, Jquery, coffeescript and refactoring.</h1>
  <p>Before I start this post, I&#8217;d like to say thanks to all for the warm reception and genuine interest we received at the <span class="caps">VLE</span> forum. Hopefully we can make this a true collaborative project in the near future!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned that we&#8217;re making a release after half-term (next week) that we will call 1.0. This is by no means going to mean a pause in development but I&#8217;m going to talk about a few changes we&#8217;ll see in 1.0</p>
<h2>Rails 3.1</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re making the jump to Rails 3.1, including use of lots of its goodness. All the images, javascript and stylesheets are using the asset pipeline. This should have a few positive effects on Leap, speed and such, but my favourite is that it&#8217;s simplifying the codebase; the javascript libraries are now stored in gems on the server so they&#8217;re removed from Leap&#8217;s repositories (I wonder if Ohloh will recognise it as a ruby project instead of a JS one now!) and only the <span class="caps">SCSS</span> source of stylesheets instead of the compiled ones. A major goal of Leap development is to kep the code small and easily maintainable by a tiny development team.</p>
<h2>Jquery</h2>
<p>Rails 3.1 has changed the default javascript framework from Prototype to Jquery, and we&#8217;re doing the same with Leap. I did like Prototype, but learning Jquery has proved interesting and I&#8217;ve been able to remove a lot of complexity where <span class="caps">AJAX</span> is used to do things like open up the extended pulldown on events. I&#8217;m hoping (but am not able to check until Monday) that it&#8217;s also going to clear up some issues I had with Internet Explorer compatibility.</p>
<h2>Coffeescript</h2>
<p>Also related with the move to Rails 3.1 and the asset pipeline, I&#8217;ve rewritten all the JS as coffeescript. I found coffeescript lovely to start to learn and makes all that ugly JS much more expressive.</p>
<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Reviews will finally be in, written to a spec we&#8217;ve come up with at South Devon College. We&#8217;ve had the stop-gap initial reviews for a while and, as it turns out, the full reviews will be much influenced by their sucess. This will be the subject of a full post to come.</p>
<h2>And more!</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s been a few smaller features: deleting events (for a configurable amount of time after they&#8217;re created) is a good example, and there&#8217;s been some more refactoring of eventable objects into pure event behaviour. After 1.0 release I&#8217;m going to have to do some serious documentation on how this stuff works&#8230;</p>
