  <h1>A Month After Launch</h1>
  <p>So Leap has been in production use at South Devon College for just over a month now. It&#8217;s seeing over a thousand logins a day (during the week) with over two thirds of those being from students.</p>
<p>As far as teething problems go, we&#8217;ve been pretty happy (touch wood). A few tweaks here and there and some problems caused by timetables (out of my control), but mostly Leap has sailed through with no outages or particularly bad problems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a learning process at the moment. It&#8217;s actually being used pretty well by students and staff already but, once things have settled, we&#8217;re going have to start helping people to really get the most out of the system.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also still a development system. I&#8217;m rolling out features all the time, but come half term (in a couple of weeks) I&#8217;m going to call it 1.0 and we&#8217;ll settle into a release cycle. To start with it&#8217;s probably going to be half-termly to begin with, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>So students have been making notes, setting and meeting targets, checking timetables and whatnot. Staff have been enthusiastic in their take-up of features like contact logs and they&#8217;ll soon be into writing the first proper reviews. By the way, reviews aren&#8217;t in the repo yet, but will be by the end of half term.</p>
<p>We now have a hastily thrown-together website for the project at http://leap-ilp.com which I&#8217;ll hopefully make a bit better when time allows.</p>
<p>We also have some features that haven&#8217;t been mentioned on this blog: home pages for courses, a &#8220;my courses&#8221; block for staff, absence reporting (although this won&#8217;t work outside of <span class="caps">SDC</span> yet) and, oh loads more. But there is an issue, which is that documentation is thin on the ground anyway. Now that the system is launched I hope to make some regular posts about the use of the system, instead of that technical stuff and then we could well tie that stuff together to make a user guide.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m off to create a presentation for the <span class="caps">RSC</span> SW <span class="caps">VLE</span> Forum on Thursday&#8230;</p>
