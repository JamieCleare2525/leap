  <h1>Home Page Screenshot</h1>
  <p>As is traditional for weblogs about developing a software system, I will start off with an apology about the lack of updates. Happily, the cause of this isn&#8217;t that development has slowed; rather it is continuing at a frantic pace to ready things for the the release of Leap into production at South Devon College.</p>
<p>Once we&#8217;ve got some breathing space I&#8217;ll post some more in depth information about things I haven&#8217;t covered yet including some really interesting (well, to me) stuff about how the different views of events are built (one line the database!) for different types of users, and I hope to actually start talking about how the system can be used from a teaching perspective.</p>
<p>For now, though, I&#8217;ve bundled up a screenshot of the home page each person sees as a nice taster of how things are going.</p>
